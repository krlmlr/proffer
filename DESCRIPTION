Description: It can be challenging to find sources of
  slowness in large workflows, and the proffer package can help.
  Proffer runs R code and displays summaries
  It runs R code and displays summaries
  to show where the code is slowest. Proffer leverages
  the pprof utility to create highly efficient, clear, easy-to-read
  interactive displays that help users find ways to reduce runtime.
  The package also contains helpers to convert profiling data
  to and from pprof format and visualize existing profiling data files.
