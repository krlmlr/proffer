# proffer

[![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/proffer)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=proffer) [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/wlandau/proffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wlandau/proffer) [![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/wlandau/proffer?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wlandau/proffer) [![Codecov](https://codecov.io/github/wlandau/proffer/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/wlandau/proffer?branch=master)

The `proffer` package profiles R code to find out where it is slowest. Visit <https://wlandau.github.io/proffer> for documentation. <https://wlandau.github.io/proffer/reference/index.html> has a complete list of available functions in the package. 

## How it works

Let's say you have some slow R code and you want to speed it up.

```{r}
system.time({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
```

Why is it so slow? Where exactly are the slow parts? The standard recommendation is to use [`profvis`](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis) to find out. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(profvis)
profvis({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
```

`profvis` makes profiling super easy, but it struggles with some use cases. When there are a lot of operations to profile, flame graphs like the one above can be [difficult to read](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/115) and [slow to respond](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/104). `proffer` uses [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) because its visualizations are fast and friendly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(proffer)
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610
```


When we navigate a web browser to <http://localhost:64610> and select the flame graph under the VIEW menu, `[<-.data.frame()` jumps out at us immediately. Apparently, the line `x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1` takes the most runtime.

![](./man/figures/flame.png)

Indeed, a look at "Top" shows we spend 85% of the runtime on `x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1`. The other operations are fast by comparison.

![](./man/figures/top.png)

So we return to our R code and avoid data frame row assignment. Much faster!

```{r}
system.time({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- rnorm(n)
  y <- rnorm(n)
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i] <- x[i] + 1
    y[i] <- y[i] + 1
  }
  x <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
})
```

## Managing the pprof server

Sometimes, your `pprof` server may not work right away. If that happens, take a look at the error logs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:50195

px # How is my background process doing?
#> PROCESS 'R', finished.

px$read_error() # Why did it quit soon?
#> [1] "sh: /user/local/bin/pprof: No such file or directory\nWarning message:\nIn system2(Sys.getenv(\"pprof_path\"), args) : error in running command\n"

# Oh, I must have set the wrong path to the pprof executable.
# Let me find out where I actually installed pprof.
system("which", "pprof")
#> "/home/landau/go/bin/pprof"

# I can put a line in my .Rprofile or .Renviron file
# to automatically tell new sessions where pprof lives.
Sys.setenv(pprof_path = "/home/landau/go/bin/pprof")

# Now, pprof should work.
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610

px
#> PROCESS 'R', running, pid 12361.

# Now a web browser should be able to open http://localhost:64610.
```

It is best to take down the `pprof` server when you are done with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
px$kill()
```

`px` is a handler to a [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) background process. To learn more about how to manage the process, have a look at the [`callr`](https://callr.r-lib.org/) documentation, particularly the function [`r_bg()`](https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html).

## Installation

The latest release of `proffer` is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("proffer")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("wlandau/proffer")
```

To use functions `pprof()` and `serve_pprof()`, you need to install [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof). If you have trouble, please do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/wlandau/proffer/issues) and ask for help.

1. [Install the Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Ensure your system can find the Go binaries. Open your command line interface of choice (e.g. Terminal or Command Prompt) and type `go version`. If you get an error, you may need to set the `PATH` environment variable as described [here for Linux](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-installation-setup-gopath-workspace/#linux) and [here for Windows](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/12/easy-go-programming-setup-for-windows/)
3. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) to set the `GOPATH` environment variables on your system. Type `go env GOPATH` in in a new terminal session verify that you set it correctly. 
4. Enter `go get -u github.com/google/pprof` in your terminal to install `pprof`
5. Find the path to the `pprof` executable. It is usually in the `bin` subdirectory of `GOPATH`, e.g. `/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`.
6. Add a line to your `.Renviron` file to set the `pprof_path` environment variable, e.g. `pprof_path=/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`.
7. Open a new R session check that pprof installed correctly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.getenv("pprof_path")
#> /home/landau/go/bin/pprof
file.exists(Sys.getenv("pprof_path"))
#> TRUE
system2(Sys.getenv("pprof_path")) # Shows the pprof help menu on Unix systems.
shell(Sys.getenv("pprof_path")) # Analogous for Windows.
```
