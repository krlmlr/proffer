The `proffer` package profiles R code to find bottlenecks. Visit <https://r-prof.github.io/proffer> for documentation. <https://r-prof.github.io/proffer/reference/index.html> has a complete list of available functions in the package. 

## Why use a profiler?

This R code is slow.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#>   user  system elapsed 
#> 82.060  28.440 110.582 
```

What exactly is slowing it down? Everyone says `for` loops are slow in R, so that must be the answer...right? Let's find out empirically.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(proffer)
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610
```


When we navigate to <http://localhost:64610> and look at the flame graph, we see `[<-.data.frame()` (i.e. `x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1`) is taking most of the runtime.

So we refactor the code to avoid data frame row assignment. Much faster, even with a `for` loop!

```{r}
system.time({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- rnorm(n)
  y <- rnorm(n)
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i] <- x[i] + 1
    y[i] <- y[i] + 1
  }
  x <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
})
```

Moral of the story: before you optimize, throw away your assumptions and run your code through a profiler. That way, you can spend your time optimizing where it counts!

## Managing the pprof server

Sometimes, your `pprof` server may not work right away. If that happens, take a look at the error logs.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:50195

px # How is my background process doing?
#> PROCESS 'R', finished.
px$is_alive()
# [1] FALSE

px$read_error() # Why did it quit soon?
#> [1] "sh: /user/local/bin/pprof: No such file or directory\nWarning message:\nIn system2(Sys.getenv(\"pprof_path\"), args) : error in running command\n"

# Oh, I must have set the wrong path to the pprof executable.
# Let me find out where I actually installed pprof.
system("which", "pprof")
#> "/home/landau/go/bin/pprof"

# I can put a line in my .Rprofile or .Renviron file
# to automatically tell new sessions where pprof lives.
Sys.setenv(pprof_path = "/home/landau/go/bin/pprof")

# Now, pprof should work.
px <- pprof({
  n <- 1e4
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
#> http://localhost:64610

px
#> PROCESS 'R', running, pid 12361.
px$is_alive()
# [1] TRUE

# Now a web browser should be able to open http://localhost:64610.
```

It is best to take down the `pprof` server when you are done with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
px$kill()
```

`px` is the handle of a [`callr`](https://github.com/r-lib/callr) background process. To learn more about how to manage the process, have a look at the [`callr`](https://callr.r-lib.org/) documentation, particularly the function [`r_bg()`](https://callr.r-lib.org/reference/r_bg.html).

## Installation

The latest release of `proffer` is available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("proffer")
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-prof/proffer")
```

To use functions `pprof()` and `serve_pprof()`, you need to install [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof). Installing `pprof` is hard, so if you have trouble, please do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/r-prof/proffer/issues) and ask for help. And if you cannot install `pprof`, then [`profvis`](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/) is an excellent alternative.

1. Install the [`RProtoBuf`](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rprotobuf) package. On Linux, you also need to install the supporting protocol buffer libraries, e.g. `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev` on Ubuntu.
1. Install [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org) and ensure the Graphviz executables appear in your `PATH` environment variable ([directions here](https://bobswift.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GVIZ/pages/131924165/Graphviz+installation)).
1. [Install the Go programming language](https://golang.org/doc/install).
1. Ensure your system can find the Go binaries. Open your command line interface of choice (e.g. Terminal or Command Prompt) and type `go version`. If you get an error, you may need to set the `PATH` environment variable as described [here for Linux](https://www.callicoder.com/golang-installation-setup-gopath-workspace/#linux) and [here for Windows](http://www.wadewegner.com/2014/12/easy-go-programming-setup-for-windows/)
1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) to set the `GOPATH` environment variables on your system. Type `go env GOPATH` in in a new terminal session verify that you set it correctly. 
1. Enter `go get -u github.com/google/pprof` in your terminal to install `pprof`
1. Find the path to the `pprof` executable. It is usually in the `bin` subdirectory of `GOPATH`, e.g. `/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`.
1. Add a line to your `.Renviron` file to set the `pprof_path` environment variable, e.g. `pprof_path=/home/landau/go/bin/pprof`. This variable tells `proffer` how to find `pprof`.
1. Open a new R session check that pprof installed correctly.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.getenv("pprof_path")
#> /home/landau/go/bin/pprof
file.exists(Sys.getenv("pprof_path"))
#> TRUE
system2(Sys.getenv("pprof_path")) # Shows the pprof help menu on Unix systems.
shell(Sys.getenv("pprof_path")) # Analogous for Windows.
```

## Similar work

### profvis

The [`profvis`](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis) is much easier to install than `proffer` and equally easy to invoke.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(profvis)
profvis({
  n <- 1e5
  x <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n), y = rnorm(n))
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    x[i, ] <- x[i, ] + 1
  }
  x
})
```

However, `profvis`-generated flame graphs can be [difficult to read](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/115) and [slow to respond to mouse clicks](https://github.com/rstudio/profvis/issues/104).

`proffer` uses [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof) to create friendlier, faster visualizations.
